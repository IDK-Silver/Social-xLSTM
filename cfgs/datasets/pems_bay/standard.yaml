# PEMS-BAY Dataset Configuration (Simplified)
# Only includes fields actually used by the Social-xLSTM system

dataset_name: "pems_bay"
feature_set: "pems_bay_v1" 
feature_schema_version: "1.0"

# Data processing parameters specific to PEMS-BAY
data:
  sequence_length: 12        # 1 hour at 5-min intervals (optimal for PEMS-BAY)
  prediction_length: 3       # 15 minutes prediction
  selected_features: ["avg_speed"]
  normalization_method: "standard"  # PEMS-BAY works well with standard normalization
  fill_missing: "zero"       # PEMS-BAY has minimal missing values, use zero filling

# Model parameter overrides for PEMS-BAY dataset
model:
  xlstm:
    # PEMS-BAY has 6 features vs Taiwan VD's 5 features
    input_size: 1        # [avg_speed, lanes, length, latitude, longitude, direction]
    output_size: 1          # Same as input for consistency
